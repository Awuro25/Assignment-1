      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I am a diagnostic radiographer with a strong passion for technology and
        innovation. While my background is in medical imaging, my curiosity for
        problem-solving and user experience has driven me to explore front-end
        web development. My goal is to merge my healthcare expertise with
        technology to create impactful digital solutions.
      </p>
      <br><br><br>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I joined AltSchool Africa to gain hands-on experience in front-end
        development and learn how to build intuitive user interfaces. I believe
        that well-designed applications enhance user interaction, making
        technology more accessible and efficient. By acquiring these skills, I
        hope to contribute meaningfully to healthcare technology.
      </p>
      <br><br><br>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My primary goal is to master front-end development and gradually expand
        into other technologies to develop medical applications that improve
        patient care and workflow in healthcare settings. Additionally, I aspire
        to give back by organizing tech training programs for the less
        privileged and possibly transitioning into a full-time tech career in
        the future.
